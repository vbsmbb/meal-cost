This project was started as a single JavaScript script. THe original source came from **https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/**. I added the index.html and the styles.css files to the project and then updated the JavaScript to pull the data from the web page instead of promots. The result was then sent to the web page instead of the console. This was a practice project working with JavaScript and the DOM.
